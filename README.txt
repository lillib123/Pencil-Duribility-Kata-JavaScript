Hello there! 

Here are the steps to open my project and run the tests. You'll need NodeJS.

1. After cloning the repostory, run npm init to install the dependencies.
2. Open test > index.html

You'll see a visual representation of the tests, and a VERY basic UI. I hope you like it and have a lovely day.
